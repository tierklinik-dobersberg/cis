*Welcome to CIS, the internal **clinic support and information system** of the Veterinary Clinic Dobersberg, Austria. - https://tierklinikdobersberg.at*

This repository holds the main part of the internal support and information system (CIS) that is deployed at the Veterinary Clinic in Dobersberg, Austria. CIS is designed to help and integrate with common infrastructure and software of a veterinary clinic. Among it's features, CIS currently controls (locks/unlocks) the main entry door, provides a electronic duty roster for our employees and integrates tightly with the (self-hosted) phone-system (PBX) 3CX. 

CIS also acts as a CRM and customer proxy to provides 3CX/mobile phones with contact information from VetInf or Neumayr installations. It's also possible to integrate CardDAV enabled contact and addressbooks. See below for a more detailed explanation of currently implemented features.
